# [1.2.1] - 2025-01-25

## New Features
- **vcpkg Package Manager Support**: Full integration with vcpkg for easy installation and dependency management
  - Created CMake config files for proper package discovery
  - Ready for submission to official vcpkg registry

## Improvements
- **WebSocket Message Queueing**: Enhanced `send()` method to properly queue messages sent immediately after `open()`
  - Messages are now queued during `CONNECTING` state and sent after connection is established
  - Ensures messages sent right after `open()` are not lost and are delivered in order
  - Updated status check to allow queueing during both `DISCONNECTED` and `CONNECTING` states

## Testing
- Added comprehensive WebSocket unit tests for send-after-open scenarios:
  - `SendImmediatelyAfterOpen_MessageQueuedAndSentAfterConnect` - Single message test
  - `SendImmediatelyAfterOpen_MultipleMessages` - Multiple messages queuing test
  - `SendImmediatelyAfterOpen_VerifyOrderPreserved` - Message ordering verification
  - `SendImmediatelyAfterOpen_LargeMessage` - Large message (5KB) queueing test

## Build System
- Added CMake installation rules for proper package export
- Created `slick_net-config.cmake.in` template for downstream projects
- Added version compatibility checking (SameMajorVersion policy)
- Improved CMake target exports with proper namespace (`slick::slick_net`)

## CI/CD
- Updated GitHub Actions CI to use GCC 14 on Linux for full C++20 coroutine support
- Removed GCC 13 compatibility workarounds for awaitable HTTP tests

## Documentation
- Added `VCPKG.md` with complete vcpkg integration guide
- Created `ports/slick-net/README.md` for port maintainers
- Added usage instructions in `ports/slick-net/usage`

# [1.2.0] - 2025-01-18

## New Features
- **C++20 Coroutine Awaitable HTTP API**: Added modern async/await interface for all HTTP methods
  - `asio::awaitable<Response> async_get(url, headers)` - Awaitable GET request
  - `asio::awaitable<Response> async_post(url, data, headers)` - Awaitable POST request
  - `asio::awaitable<Response> async_put(url, data, headers)` - Awaitable PUT request
  - `asio::awaitable<Response> async_patch(url, data, headers)` - Awaitable PATCH request
  - `asio::awaitable<Response> async_del(url, data, headers)` - Awaitable DELETE request
  - Clean async/await syntax using `co_await` for sequential or parallel HTTP operations
  - Uses caller's executor context (no service thread management required)
  - Supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols
  - **Note**: GCC 13 has a known compiler bug with coroutine lambdas. Awaitable tests are disabled on GCC 13. Use GCC 14+ or Clang for full awaitable support.
